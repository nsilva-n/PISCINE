# PISCINE

*Oh daring navigator of shallow waters, prepare thyself to embark on a journey not through perilous oceans, but through the placid, tiled depths of the swimming pool!*

Within this repository lies **piscine**, a tale of perseverance and exploration in the gentle waves of programming. Here, you shall wade through exercises, learn the art of algorithms, and emerge as a coder ready to sail the vast seas of software development.

## Prelude: The Swimming Pool of Knowledge

*In a world where the deep seas of programming loom large, there exists a haven for the fledgling coderâ€”a swimming pool where skills are honed, one lap at a time.*

The **Piscine**, or "swimming pool," is not merely a collection of exercises; it is a rite of passage. Within this pool, you shall confront challenges, from the rippling currents of pointers to the whirlpools of linked lists, all while mastering the strokes of C programming.

Fear not the shallow waters, for they are but the prelude to grander depths. In this pool, you shall learn to breathe the syntax of C, to paddle through memory allocation, and to dive gracefully into the logic of algorithms.

## The Quest

*Take heart, O novice coder, for the Piscine beckons you to its waters!*

Your mission is to complete a series of exercises designed to build your foundation in programming. Each task is a step closer to mastering the art of coding, where you shall swim through the currents of logic, data structures, and algorithms.

This journey is not one of haste but of perseverance, where each lap in the pool strengthens your resolve and sharpens your skills.

## Features

*Behold the treasures that await within the Piscine:*

- **Progressive Challenges**: Exercises that gradually increase in complexity.
- **Memory Management**: Mastery over pointers, malloc, and free.
- **Data Structures**: An introduction to linked lists, arrays, and other foundational concepts.
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Develop problem-solving skills that are the cornerstone of programming.

---

## Requirements

*Equip thyself with these tools to navigate the waters of the Piscine:*

- **Compiler**: GCC or Clang.
- **Development Environment**: Any text editor or IDE that supports C programming.
- **Makefile**: Automate your build process with targets `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, and `re`.

## Getting Started

*Step into the shallow end and let the learning begin!*

Clone this repository and navigate to the `piscine` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nsilva-n/PISCINE.git
cd PISCINE
make
```

## Exercises and Challenges

*The Piscine is a series of laps, each more challenging than the last:*

### Example Exercises
1. **`ft_strlen`**: Implement a function that calculates the length of a string.
2. **`ft_strcpy`**: Copy one string into another.
3. **`ft_strdup`**: Duplicate a string using dynamic memory allocation.
4. **`ft_list_push_back`**: Manipulate linked lists by adding new elements.

### Advanced Challenges
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implement and optimize sorting techniques.
- **Recursion**: Solve problems using recursive approaches.
- **File I/O**: Read from and write to files.

*Each exercise is a ripple in the pool, bringing you closer to the mastery of programming.*

---

## Testing

*Test thy code against the trials of correctness and efficiency!*  

### Debugging
Use tools like `valgrind` to ensure no memory leaks or invalid accesses:
```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./exercise_name
```

### Peer Reviews
Collaborate with fellow swimmers by reviewing each other's code. The Piscine is as much about teamwork as it is about individual growth.
